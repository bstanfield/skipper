                        The three of us have worked together in teams (ranging from 3 to over 40 teammates) for the past two years, and noticed how culture changes when teams change and grow. With this in mind, we started Skipper as a simple research project. Our personal investment in the problem space grew as questions about diversity and inclusion in tech sprang up this year.

                        Weâ€™ve since developed Skipper into a full-fledged product that helps you identify people management problems to solve more effectively with access to data. As a small, flexible team, we're excited to work closely with you to create a product that seamlessly integrates itself into your organization.
